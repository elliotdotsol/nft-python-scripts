# NFT Python Scripts

This is a list with some python scripts that can be useful whilst developing NFT collections on any chain.


## Scripts

1. File conversion to JSON format
1. Degrade file names by a number
1. Remove leading zeros in file name
1. Collect metadata_link and mint_account and bundle them in one JSON file 


## Usage/Examples

#### Script 1: File conversion to JSON format (v1)

Let's say you have a bunch of wallets that you want to airdrop some NFTs to. But you have received a CSV or TXT file with for example the following format:

walletAddress, numberOfNFTs
```
msKvnWvUr6tgitEWyduHVFuUgaNKarXRcn,1
mig1oqWaWnJYFduRAEdtswvLEQ4ubQuDhh,5
```
It will then convert it to a JSON format that looks like this:
```
{
    "msKvnWvUr6tgitEWyduHVFuUgaNKarXRcn": 1,
    "mig1oqWaWnJYFduRAEdtswvLEQ4ubQuDhh": 5
}
```
Then with the JSON file you can use it to airdrop NFTs with popular tools such as Sugar Airdrop for Solana Candy Machine.

#### Script 1: File conversion to JSON format (v2)
Same concept as version 1 but for strings. We've used this script to replace NFT attributes in the metadata.
For example this CSV or TXT format:
```
string1, string2
string3, string4
```
Will convert to this:
```
{
    "string1": "string2",
    "string3": "string4"
}
```
Useful to mass replace a lot of strings based of a JSON format.

#### Script 2: Degrade file names by a number
Let's say you have received assets for a Solana NFT collection but they are named in the following format:
```
1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc.
1.json, 2.json, 3.json, etc.
```
But you need this format:
```
0.png, 1.png, 2.png, etc.
0.json, 1.json, 2.json, etc.
```
You can use this script to accomplish that for however many files you have in a matter of seconds.

#### Script 3: Remove leading zeros in file name
Let's say you're developing a NFT collection but have received files that are named in the following format:
```
0001.png, 0002.png, 0003.png, etc.
0001.json, 0002.json, 0003.json, etc.
```
But you need this format:
```
1.png, 2.png, 3.png, etc.
1.json, 2.json, 3.json, etc.
```
You can use this script to accomplish that for however many files you have in a matter of seconds.

#### Script 4: Collect metadata_link and mint_account and bundle them in one JSON file
This script is useful for Solana NFT development with Metaplex Candy Machine & Metaboss.

Sometimes revealing using ```sugar reveal``` does not work due to how the function works, then you need [Metaboss](https://metaboss.rs/overview.html) to mass [update all your NFTs' URIs](https://metaboss.rs/update.html). To collect them all, you can use this script.

In your cache.json file (from your deployed NFT collection on Solana) you need the ```metadata_link``` from your items.

Your ```cache.json``` items look something like this:
```
"items": {
    "0": {
      "name": "NFT #1",
      "image_hash": "hiddenForPrivacy",
      "image_link": "hiddenForPrivacy",
      "metadata_hash": "hiddenForPrivacy",
      "metadata_link": "https://arweave.net/N36gZYJ6PEH8OE11i0MppIbPG4VXKV4iuQw1zaq3rls",
      "onChain": false
    },
    "1": {
      "name": "NFT #2",
      "image_hash": "hiddenForPrivacy",
      "image_link": "hiddenForPrivacy",
      "metadata_hash": "hiddenForPrivacy",
      "metadata_link": "https://arweave.net/FPGAv1XnyZidnqquOdEbSY6_ES735ckcDTdaAtI7GFw",
      "onChain": false
    }
}
```
But you also need the ```mint_account``` from your current 'hidden' NFTs that are deployed onchain. These you get by using the [```metaboss snapshot```](https://metaboss.rs/snapshot.html) command.

The file generated by Metaboss looks something like this:
```
[
  {
    "owner_wallet": "hiddenForPrivacy",
    "mint_account": "xZ43...",
    "metadata_account": "hiddenForPrivacy",
    "associated_token_address": "hiddenForPrivacy"
  },
  {
    "owner_wallet": "hiddenForPrivacy",
    "mint_account": "71bk...",
    "metadata_account": "hiddenForPrivacy",
    "associated_token_address": "hiddenForPrivacy"
  }
]
```
From this file the script extracts only the ```mint_account``` and from your cache.json file it only extracts the ```metadata_link``` and bundles them together in one file with the format that Metaboss accepts:
```
[
    {
        "mint_account": "xZ43...",
        "new_uri": "https://arweave.net/N36gZYJ6PEH8OE11i0MppIbPG4VXKV4iuQw1zaq3rls"
    },
        {
        "mint_account": "71bk...",
        "new_uri": "https://arweave.net/FPGAv1XnyZidnqquOdEbSY6_ES735ckcDTdaAtI7GFw"
    }
]
```
